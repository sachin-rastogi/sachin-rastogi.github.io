title: About

I am a data scientist who comes from the **Econometrics and Statistics** background, but who is constantly expanding technical and analytical skills through coursework, projects, and self-learning.  I may even hold the record for most universities at which one has taken a course, with seven!

After completing my Master's in Economics, I worked for five years as a **senior healthcare policy and data analyst** at [Acumen](https://www.acumenllc.com), an established government consulting firm with access to the full universe of Medicare fee-for-service claims and enrollment data, as well as other provider, clinical, financial, and survey data.  I specialized in **statistical programming** using multiple statistical packages, and led programming efforts to investigate the effects of various healthcare interventions (Medicare payment policies, purchasing incentives, indicators of patient socioeconomic status, and weather emergencies) on service utilization and outcomes of chronic disease beneficiaries.

I also really enjoy the **story-telling, teamwork, and mentoring** aspects of my data science work and bring value through productive collaboration with clients and other stakeholders, presenting
results and recommendations to non-technical audiences, managing project teams, and teaching:

* Presented results of teamâ€™s work at annual CMS Quality Conference in Baltimore, MD in December 2014
* Contributed to and was named in acknowledgments on four published research [articles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B8IBA9gAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Supervised and mentored six junior programmer analysts and interns, assigning schedules and procedures for completion of work
* Taught weekly Statistics lab session to a class of 27 undergraduate students
* Active as an answerer on [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/13836144) sites (Programming, Economics, Statistics, Data Science)

While completing a **Python & deep learning** data science internship at a computer vision startup, I am now on the lookout for exciting opportunities where I can leverage my skillset to derive actionable insights from data and to help build data-based products.

In my spare time, I really enjoy travel and photography and invite you to check out some of my photos in the [Photo Gallery](https://sasha-kap.github.io/gallery).
